Vector Databases and Embeddings

Vector databases store and query vector embeddings, enabling efficient similarity searches based on semantic meaning. 
​ They play a crucial role in RAG systems by facilitating fast information retrieval. 
​

Vector embeddings capture semantic properties of data. 
​
Similarity search uses metrics like cosine similarity and Euclidean distance. 
​
Essential for recommendation systems and NLP tasks.
